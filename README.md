n16-shell is a collection of shell components for my nixos rice, focusing on the niri window manager and using the wayland layer_shell protocol to appear as a non-tiling window.

It uses [base16 theming](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for integration with [stylix](https://stylix.danth.me/) and my nixos configuration as a whole.

n16-shell is written in rust for better compatibility with niri and because rust is one of the most accesible systems programming languages currently. _(C is cringe and you can't change my mind)_
